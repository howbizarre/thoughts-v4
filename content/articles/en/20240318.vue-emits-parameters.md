Passing events in **Vue** from a component back to the one that calls it is done with **emits**. The emits can also be done with **Pinia** or another library for state management, but this will be for another article.

## What is a page and what is a component?

I am often asked: '*Should I extract this code into components or leave it on the page?*'. I have built myself a basic rule - if I have the question, whether this code should become a component, it should become a component. I also group the components by certain characteristics. I often give the [@layer](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#layer) directive of **TailwindCSS** as an example when someone wonders how to group their components.

I divide the components into 2 types:

1. **Speculators**: Those that do not perform any business logic, but only draw and/or transfer data;
2. **Workers**: Those that perform secondary processing of the incoming parameters and add business logic, which they return to the calling component.

**Workers** can often call other **workers** or **speculators**, while **Speculators** usually work independently.

## How are parameters passed?

Let's make an example. We have a component (**Speculator**) that shows on the screen how many more product pages are left before the last page is reached. We call it `LoadMore.vue`. The input parameters of the component are 2: '**which number is the current page**' and '**how many are the total number of pages**'. The component does not perform any business logic. It calculates how many more pages are left and draws them.

```vue
// components/utilities/LoadMore.vue

<script lang="ts" setup>
defineProps<{
  page: number; // current page
  totalPages: number; // total number of pages
}>();
</script>

<template>
  <p>{{ `There are ${(totalPages - page)} more page${(totalPages - page) > 1 ? 's' : ''}` }}</p>
</template>
```

### Direct event passing

Let's rework our component a bit so that when it is clicked, it passes the event to the calling component, which fires a function.

```vue
// components/utilities/LoadMore.vue

<script lang="ts" setup>
  defineProps<{
    page: number;
    totalPages: number;
  }>();
</script>

<template>
  <div class="col-12 text-center q-mt-md q-mb-xl">
    <button @click="$emit('loadMore', page)"
            :label="`There are ${(totalPages - page)} more page${(totalPages - page) > 1 ? 's' : ''}`"
            class="btn btn-action btn-action--micro" />
  </div>
</template>
```

This is a direct way to pass the event. When the button is clicked, the `loadMore` event and the `page` parameter are passed to the calling component.

```vue
// pages/Products.vue

<script lang="ts" setup>
  import LoadMore from '@/components/utilities/LoadMore.vue';
  import { ref } from 'vue';

  const page = ref(1);
  const totalPages = ref(10);

  const loadMore = (page: number) => {
    console.log(`Load more products from page ${page}`);
  };
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <LoadMore :page="page" :totalPages="totalPages" @load-more="loadMore" />
  </div>
</template>
```

I always use **kebab-case** for emitted events.

### Define emit

When you want to make some changes to the parameters you are passing before emitting the event, you will need to define the emit.

```vue
// components/utilities/LoadMore.vue

<script lang="ts" setup>
  defineProps<{
    page: number;
    totalPages: number;
  }>();

  const emit = defineEmits(['loadMore']);

  /**
  * Change the page number and emit "loadMore" with the updated number.
   * @param {number} page - The current page number
   */
  const changePage = (page: number) => {
    const nextPage = page + 1;

    emit('loadMore', nextPage);
  };
</script>

<template>
  <div class="col-12 text-center q-mt-md q-mb-xl">
    <button @click="changePage(page)"
            :label="`There are ${(totalPages - page)} more page${(totalPages - page) > 1 ? 's' : ''}`"
            class="btn btn-action btn-action--micro" />
  </div>
</template>
```

This way we now have a lot of control over the output parameters.

```vue
// pages/Products.vue

<script lang="ts" setup>
  import LoadMore from '@/components/utilities/LoadMore.vue';
  import { ref } from 'vue';

  const page = ref(1);
  const totalPages = ref(10);

  const loadMore = (page: number) => {
    console.log(`Load more products from page ${page}`);
  };
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <LoadMore :page="page" :totalPages="totalPages" @load-more="loadMore" />
  </div>
</template>
```

This example is just illustrative. If a similar change to the page number is being made, it should be logic in the calling component. But for our example, it's a great way to see how you can take control of the returned data.
