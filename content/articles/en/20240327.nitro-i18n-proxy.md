When you use **Nuxt**, it is normal to use **Nitro** as well, but sometimes this does not fit into the scenario you have been prepared for. The API requests are handled by another back-end server and in order to develop the application locally, a proxy must be set up.

<!-- more -->

Nitro has a description in the documentation on how to set up the devProxy, and everything works fine until I encountered a Nuxt application with an active **i18n** module with several language localizations and configured in **prefix** strategy. With the prefix strategy, the URL address is automatically replaced and the devProxy stops working.

```javascript
// nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    devProxy: {
      "/~": {
        target: "http://127.0.0.1:3243/",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In our case, all requests starting with `/~`, for example: `/~/api/request/method`, Nitro redirects them to another back-end server. But when the language culture `/en/~/api/request/method` is unexpectedly added to the address and Nitro stops communicating with the other server. That's why we quickly enriched the devProxy configuration.

```javascript
// nuxt.config.ts

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    devProxy: {
      "/bg/~": {
        target: "http://127.0.0.1:1818/",
      },
      "/en/~": {
        target: "http://127.0.0.1:1818/",
      },
      "/~": {
        target: "http://127.0.0.1:1818/",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The idea was to confirm that this will work, but so far I have not found another way. The problem comes when adding a new language localization. Each one must be added to the devProxy configuration. Drop a line if you know a more cultured way.
