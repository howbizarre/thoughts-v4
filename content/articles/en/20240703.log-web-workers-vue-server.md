**Web Workers** are small, powerful scripts that run in the browser's background. And because they don't interfere with the rendering of your application, you can load them with various tasks to perform.

<!-- more -->

I use Web Workers in two ways - in the first one, they don't return information to the application and after finishing the work, they self-destruct. In the second one, they return a result and then the application takes care of when and if the Web Worker should be destroyed. Here we will look at only the first way of working. I will write a separate article for the second one.

## LOG WORKER

I most often use the first way of working for Web Workers to log information from the application to the server, but not only.

I create a directory called `workers` and in it, I create a file - in our case `LOGS.ts`. The file is always in capital letters, so I can easily recognize it when importing it, and has a speaking name. Over time, I have concluded that every type of task that a given Web Worker performs should be in a separate file.

```typescript
// workers/LOGS.ts

import axios from "axios";

self.onmessage = async (event) => {
  const { message, code, type } = event.data;
  await axios.post("/api/log", { type: `${message}`, statusCode: code }, { contentType: "text/plain" });

  /**
   * Log Worker does not return data,
   * so we close the worker after the POST request,
   * even if there is an error with writing to the server,
   * the worker will close.
   */
  self.close();
};
```

To use Web Workers in your application, you need to be very careful with its import. For **Vue 3** with **Composition API** and `<script lang='ts' setup>`, there is a special directive `worker`, similar to a `query string` in the file path.

```typescript
import LOGS from "~/workers/LOGS?worker";
```

Using it is easy and most often I call it from a `try-catch` block to write the errors to the server.

```vue
// criticalJob.vue

<script lang='ts' setup>
import LOGS from "~/workers/LOGS?worker";

const doSomeCriticalJob = async (id: string) => {
  try {
    // await do some critical job
  } catch (error) {
    const logsWorker = new LOGS();
    logsWorker.postMessage({ message: `Critical Job with ID: ${id} got error: ${error}`, code: 500, type: "error" });
  }
};
</script>
