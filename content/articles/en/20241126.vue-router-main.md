When starting a new **Vue** project, I use the **Quick Start** section of the Vue website. Then, I make a few small changes before adding the project to the Source Control bank.

<!--more-->

From the questions that `npm create vue@latest` asks me, I almost always choose:

```shell
√ Add TypeScript? ... no / YES
√ Add Vue Router for Single Page Application development? ... no / YES
√ Add Pinia for state management? ... no / YES
√ Add an End-to-End Testing Solution? » Playwright
```

The others, if necessary during development.

After executing all the instructions that appear on the screen, you get a project ready to start. The first thing I edit is the Main file - `src/main.ts`.

At the beginning, it looks like this:

```typescript
import './assets/main.css'

import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createPinia } from 'pinia'

import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(createPinia())
app.use(router)

app.mount('#app')
```

There is a small hidden secret here that you probably don't know. Sometimes, it may happen that the Vue application loads before the router is initialized. To avoid the appearance of such Vue jokes, I edit `src/main.ts`:

```typescript
import "./assets/main.css";

import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createPinia } from "pinia";

import App from "./App.vue";

initializeApp();

async function initializeApp(): Promise<void> {
  const app = createApp(App);
  const pinia = createPinia();

  const { default: router } = await import("@/router");

  app.use(router);
  app.use(pinia);

  await router.isReady();
  app.mount("#app");
}  
```

This way, the router is initialized before the Vue application is loaded. A tiny trick that will save you from possible future problems.
