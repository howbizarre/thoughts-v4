When I write a plugin, I think of it as a standalone piece of code that has its own logic and is independent of where it will be used. This is not entirely true, of course, but when designing a plugin, I always start from this idea. After all, every system has its own logic and architecture that must be followed - especially for outgoing data.

## Geo location

In *modern browsers*, it is very easy to access the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API). You call

```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(call_success_function, call_error_function);
```

and in the object returned to `call_success_function` you will get everything you need, including **latitude** & **longitude**. If necessary, you can check if the browser supports the Geolocation API `if (!navigator.geolocation) { ... } else { ... }`.

I will add a small abstraction to the standard function to make it work in an asynchronous environment.

```typescript
async function GeoLocation(): Promise<GeolocationCoordinates> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(location.coords),
      (error) => reject(error)
    );
  });
}
```

A wonderful method that will return the coordinates and (as I told you at the beginning) works regardless of the environment in which it will be used.

## Vue plugin

In a project where we want to use the above method as a plugin, I create a folder `plugins` and in it I create a sub-folder `geo-location`. In this folder I add 2 files - `index.ts` and `GeoLocation.ts`. Of course, the content of `GeoLocation.ts` is the above method.

```typescript
// plugins/geo-location/GeoLocation.ts

export async function GeoLocation(): Promise<GeolocationCoordinates> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (success) => resolve(location.coords),
      (error) => reject(error)
    );
  });
}
```

In `index.ts` I follow the standard structure of Vue plugins.

```typescript
// plugins/geo-location/index.ts

import type { App } from "vue";
import { GeoLocation } from "./GeoLocation";

export default {
  install(app: App) {
    app.provide("GeoLocation", GeoLocation);
  },
};
```
Then we add it to `main.ts`.

```typescript
// main.ts

import { createApp } from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";
import GeoLocationPlugin from "./plugins/geo-location";

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(GeoLocationPlugin);
app.mount("#app");
```

## Using the plugin

Here is the reason for writing this article. To use the plugin in a **TypeScript** environment, you need to be careful with the initialization in the Vue component where you will use it.

```typescript
const GEOLocation = inject<() => Promise<GeolocationCoordinates>>('GeoLocation');
```

If you omit the cast `() => Promise<GeolocationCoordinates>`, you will get an error that `GeoLocation` is not a function.

::note
You can also define your own type:

  ```typescript
  type GeoLocationType = () => Promise<GeolocationCoordinates>;
  const GEOLocation = inject<GeoLocationType>('GeoLocation');
  ```
