# What is competence?

Competence shows how familiar you should be with the technologies mentioned in the article.

- [**None**](/en/competence/none): No technical experience required;
- [**Elementary**](/en/competence/elementary): You know `Getting Started` by heart;
- [**Pro**](/en/competence/pro): You use the technology and its toolings;
- [**Geek**](/en/competence/geek): You have more answers than questions;

You may think of it as the category of the article. An article has only one competence/category.

## What are tags?

Tags, are an easy way to filter the articles you see in a given field, technology, idea, etc.

I often write about a given technology or a set of technologies. Then the tags indicate what these technologies are. Sometimes they won't be related to technology, but to my thoughts or interesting things from the network or the life around me that I note.

## What are the technologies?

The main technologies I write about are mostly focused on front-end, but there will also be content about back-end, tools, clouds, patterns, best practices, and more.

## Who am I?

>I am a Front-end Senpai, who strictly follows the W3Code of Bushido!.

For translation from my native language, Bulgarian, to English, I use some AI helpers such as **DeepL**, **CoPilot**, **Gemini**, and **Google Translate** with corrections, and adjustments. I am not a native English speaker, so please let me know if you find any mistakes. Thank you!
